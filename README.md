The Powerball Simulator is a program designed with C# and XAML that demonstrates the odds of winning money by playing Powerball.
It is not endorsed or approved by Powerball in any way, shape, or form, but was a fun way for me to work with OOP concepts and build
a desktop application that I would enjoy.

Currently, the program allows you to generate a new game, which populates all six numbers randomly and allows you to generate a random
guess, which will be compared to the numbers chosen. Following the rules of Powerball, your "earnings" will be tallied based number
matching rules. However, your "costs" will be tallied as well.

I am still implementing of the logic behind the interface and will update this file as progress is made. I wanted to get this started
and get it up on Github for others to see.
